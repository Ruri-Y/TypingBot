# TypingBot
_for Discord (just for fun)_

This bot makes your account type forever in a certain channel as long as your pc exists

## Installation

If you still don't have python installed. Download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/)

then download this [repo](https://github.com/Ruri-Y/TypingBot/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract it to folder, go to the folder where the files are and start your cmd inside that folder.

and then run this command:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py
```


**I don't recommend running this on replit**. If you're using mobile (android) please use Termux instead.

Contact me on discord if you need help.
